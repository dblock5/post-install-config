First, I created and configured Roles. Which are permissions granted to agents per department that they have access to. I went on the Admin Panel, clicked agents, then roles, and then added a new role called admin. Then granted admin permissions to do anything such as delete tickets and create tickets etc. Then I created a new department. I clicked admin panel, agents, then departments. Then I added a new department called System Administrators

<p>
Then I created different teams. In osTicket teams allows you to pull agents from different departments and organize them to handle a specific problem. I went on the admin panel, agents, then clicked teams. Then I created a new team called Level II Support, and assigned an agent to the team, and created some agents. On the admin panel, clicked agent panel and added a couple of agents and assigned them to different departments and added them to a team.
